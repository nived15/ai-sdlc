/**
 * Rollback helper for failed dispatches (AISDLC-177).
 *
 * Witness (2026-05-03/04): the orchestrator dispatched AISDLC-70, Step 4
 * flipped status to "In Progress" and wrote the per-worktree
 * `.active-task` sentinel, then Step 6 failed with `outcome:
 * "developer-failed"`. The orchestrator recorded the failure and exited —
 * leaving:
 *   - task status stuck at "In Progress" (was "To Do")
 *   - `.worktrees/<task-id>/` left on disk with a stale branch
 *   - `.active-task` sentinel still present
 *   - any commits the dev produced stranded on a branch nobody owned
 *
 * Operator had to manually `git worktree remove --force`, edit the task
 * file to revert status, delete the sentinel, and (in the AISDLC-70 case)
 * recover a valid commit before it was reaped.
 *
 * This module owns the inverse of those four side-effects:
 *   1. Revert task status to its pre-dispatch value via the same
 *      frontmatter-patching helper Step 4 used (no MCP-tool dependency
 *      from inside the orchestrator).
 *   2. Optionally rename the dev's branch under `quarantine/<id>-<ts>`
 *      when it carries commits beyond `origin/main` so the work isn't
 *      destroyed — guarded by `isReallyStale()` (AISDLC-228) so an
 *      active branch is never quarantined mid-flight.
 *   3. Remove the worktree via `git worktree remove --force`. The
 *      sentinel goes with it.
 *   4. Return a structured `RollbackResult` so the caller can mint
 *      `OrchestratorRollback` + `OrchestratorWorkQuarantined` events.
 *
 * Pure adapter pattern: every side-effect goes through the injected
 * `Runner` so tests can drive the helper without touching the real git
 * tree.

 * AISDLC-228 — Determine whether a branch with commits ahead of origin/main

 *
 * Returns `{ stale: false, reason }` when ANY single signal says "in-flight".
 * Returns `{ stale: true }` only when ALL four signals are quiet.
 *
 * The four signals:
 * 1. **Unpushed commits on an upstream branch** — when the branch has a
 *    tracking remote AND is ahead of that remote (not just ahead of
 *    origin/main), those commits are already being pushed and must not be
 *    clobbered. When there's NO upstream the branch is local-only, which
 *    is still a "not stale" signal because the dev may be mid-push.
 * 2. **Active `.active-task` sentinel** — `<worktree>/.active-task` modified
 *    within the last 6 hours. A fresh sentinel means a live session is using
 *    this worktree right now.
 * 3. **Live `copilot -p` subprocess** — a `copilot -p` (or `-p`)
 *    process whose argv contains the task ID is running in the OS process
 *    table. Best-effort; silently skipped on ps errors.
 * 4. **Open GitHub PR** — `gh pr list --head <branch> --state open` returns
 *    ≥1 entry. An open PR means commits are in review; quarantining would
 *    break the PR's source ref.
 *
 * Async to allow the gh PR check (network call via Runner, not execSync).
 * The caller (rollbackDispatch) wraps this in its own try/catch so any
 * unexpected failure falls through to the conservative "stale" verdict
 * (since we're checking after countCommitsAhead already found commits,
 * defaulting to quarantine on error is acceptable — it's the same
 * behaviour as before AISDLC-228).
