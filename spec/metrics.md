## 1. Introduction

Beyond DORA's four keys, AI-augmented development requires purpose-built measurements. This document defines the AI-SDLC metrics framework, OpenTelemetry integration conventions, provenance tracking requirements, and audit trail specifications.

Metrics serve two purposes in the AI-SDLC Framework:
1. **Governance** — Metrics drive [promotion](glossary.md#promotion) and [demotion](glossary.md#demotion) decisions in the [autonomy system](autonomy.md)
2. **Observability** — Metrics provide visibility into the health and performance of AI-augmented development workflows

---

## 2. Metric Categories

<!-- Source: PRD Section 14.1 -->

The framework defines five metric categories. Implementations MUST support collecting and reporting metrics from at least the first three categories (Task Effectiveness, Human-in-Loop, Code Quality).

## 3. OpenTelemetry Integration

<!-- Source: PRD Section 14.2 -->

The framework SHOULD define semantic conventions for AI-SDLC observability, extending OpenTelemetry's GenAI semantic conventions. All metric, trace, and log attribute names MUST use the `ai_sdlc.*` namespace prefix.

### 3.1 Traces

Implementations SHOULD generate spans for the following operations:

| Span Name | Description | Attributes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ai_sdlc.pipeline.stage` | One span per pipeline stage execution | `pipeline`, `stage`, `agent` |
| `ai_sdlc.agent.task` | One span per agent task execution | `agent`, `task_type`, `complexity` |
| `ai_sdlc.gate.evaluation` | One span per quality gate evaluation | `gate`, `enforcement`, `result` |
| `ai_sdlc.reconciliation.cycle` | One span per reconciliation cycle | `resource_kind`, `resource_name`, `result` |
| `ai_sdlc.handoff` | One span per agent handoff | `source_agent`, `target_agent`, `contract_id` |

Spans SHOULD be linked into traces following the pipeline execution flow:

```
pipeline.stage (implement)
  └─→ agent.task (code-agent)
       ├─→ gate.evaluation (test-coverage)
       └─→ gate.evaluation (security-scan)
  └─→ handoff (code-agent → reviewer-agent)
pipeline.stage (review)
  └─→ agent.task (reviewer-agent)
       └─→ gate.evaluation (human-review)
```

### 3.2 Metrics

Implementations MUST expose metrics using the names and types defined in [Section 2](#2-metric-categories). Metrics SHOULD be exportable via OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP).

**Instrument types:**
- **Gauge** — For values that can go up and down (e.g., autonomy level, rates)
- **Counter** — For values that only increase (e.g., escalation count)
- **Histogram** — For distributions (e.g., task completion time, cost per task)

### 3.3 Logs

Implementations MUST produce structured logs for the following events:

| Event | Required Fields | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `reconciliation.decision` | resource, action, reason, result | Every reconciliation decision |
| `autonomy.promotion` | agent, from_level, to_level, criteria_met | Agent promoted |
| `autonomy.demotion` | agent, from_level, to_level, trigger | Agent demoted |
| `gate.override` | gate, actor, role, justification | Quality gate overridden |
| `gate.failure` | gate, enforcement, reason | Quality gate failed |
| `handoff.completed` | source, target, contract, validation_result | Agent handoff completed |

Logs MUST be structured (JSON) and SHOULD be exportable via OTLP.

## 4. Provenance Tracking

<!-- Source: PRD Section 14.3 -->

Every AI-generated artifact MUST record [provenance](glossary.md#provenance) metadata. Provenance enables attribution, auditability, and regulatory compliance.

### 4.1 Required Fields

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `model` | string | MUST | Model identifier (e.g., `the balanced tier`). |

| `humanReviewer` | string | MAY | Identity of the human who reviewed the artifact. |
| `reviewDecision` | string | MAY | One of: `approved`, `rejected`, `revised`. |
| `cost` | CostReceipt | MAY | Cost breakdown for this artifact. See RFC-0004. |

#### CostReceipt Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `totalCost` | number | MUST | Total cost of producing this artifact. |
| `currency` | string | MUST | Currency code (e.g., USD). |

### 4.2 Storage

Provenance metadata SHOULD be stored:
- In commit metadata (git trailers or notes)
- In PR descriptions or comments
- In a dedicated provenance store accessible via API

Implementations MUST ensure provenance records are immutable after creation.

### 4.3 Attribution

When [QualityGate](spec.md#53-qualitygate) rules include `requireAttribution: true`, implementations MUST verify that provenance metadata is present and complete before admitting the artifact.

## 5. Audit Trail Requirements

### 5.2 Immutability

Audit log entries MUST NOT be modifiable after creation. Implementations SHOULD use append-only storage with integrity verification (e.g., hash chains, write-once storage).

### 5.3 Retention

Implementations SHOULD support configurable retention policies for audit logs. The default retention period SHOULD be at least 12 months to support regulatory compliance.

### 5.4 Access

Audit logs MUST be accessible to authorized users via API. Implementations SHOULD support filtering by actor, action, resource, and time range.
