/**
 * Entry point for `cli-tui` (RFC-0023 Phase 1 / AISDLC-178.1).
 *
 * Compiled to `dist/tui/index.js` and invoked from `bin/cli-tui.mjs`.
 *
 * Behaviour:
 *   1. Check `AI_SDLC_TUI` opt-in (RFC-0023 §14). If unset/false, print the
 *      disabled message to stderr and exit 1.
 *   2. Otherwise, dynamically import Ink + the App component (deferred so
 *      the disabled-flag path doesn't pay the React/Ink import cost) and
 *      render the Overview Mode inside the terminal alt-screen buffer.
 *
 * Alt-screen buffer (AISDLC-236):
 *   Without alt-screen mode Ink uses an erase-previous-lines strategy
 *   (`log-update`) to redraw. When the rendered height changes between
 *   frames (e.g. list navigation grows/shrinks the output), the line
 *   count becomes stale and subsequent erases leave orphaned rows above
 *   the new frame — producing the visible "content drifts down" symptom.
 *
 *   The fix emits `\e[?1049h` on entry (switches to the alternate screen
 *   buffer, a blank slate where Ink can use `clearTerminal` reliably) and
 *   `\e[?1049l` on exit (restores the primary buffer + pre-TUI scroll
 *   history). This is the approach used by every full-screen terminal UI
 *   (vim, htop, less, etc.) and requires a terminal that supports
 *   xterm-style alternate-screen sequences — which is universally true
 *   for every modern terminal emulator.
 *
 *   Ink's `patchConsole: true` is also explicitly set (it is the default,
 *   but making it explicit guards against callers accidentally disabling
 *   it) so that any `console.log` / `console.error` calls inside the
 *   component tree are routed through Ink's output buffer rather than
 *   stomping the render directly on stdout.
 *
 *   Error handling: uncaught exceptions + unhandled rejections are
 *   captured BEFORE Ink mounts and written to stderr AFTER Ink unmounts
 *   so the operator can see what went wrong once the alt-screen has been
 *   restored (AC#7).
 *
 * Returning the render handle is intentionally avoided — the Ink render
 * loop owns the process lifecycle until the user hits `q` or Ctrl+C.
