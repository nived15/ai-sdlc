# AISDLC-272: Resolve the pipeline-cli bin directory across all install topologies.
#
# Outputs the resolved PIPELINE_CLI_BIN path to stdout (no trailing newline).
# Exits 0 on success, 1 when no usable install is found.
#
# Resolution order (first match wins):
#
#   1. CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DIR set + node_modules/@ai-sdlc/pipeline-cli/bin exists
#      → Standard marketplace install with bundled deps. Use it.
#
#   2. CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DIR set + node_modules missing
#      → Broken/incomplete install. Try to self-heal via install-runtime-deps.sh,
#        then retry. If self-heal fails, fall through.
#
#   3. COPILOT_PLUGIN_ROOT set (always injected by GitHub Copilot CLI) + node_modules exists
#      → Use COPILOT_PLUGIN_ROOT as the install dir (same directory, different var).
#
#   4. Plugin cache probe: ~/.copilot/plugins/cache/<marketplace>/ai-sdlc/<version>/
#      → Walk all marketplace caches, find the highest installed version that has
#        node_modules/@ai-sdlc/pipeline-cli/bin. Use it.
#
#   5. Monorepo dogfood fallback: $(pwd)/pipeline-cli/bin
#      → Works when run from within the ai-sdlc monorepo. Fails in adopter projects.
#
#   6. Nothing found → print actionable error to stderr, exit 1.
#
# Usage (called from execute.md path-resolution preamble):
#
#   PIPELINE_CLI_BIN=$(bash "$PLUGIN_SCRIPTS_DIR/resolve-pipeline-cli.sh") || exit 1
#
# Environment variables read:
#   CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DIR  — set by GitHub Copilot CLI harness for marketplace installs
#   COPILOT_PLUGIN_ROOT — always set by GitHub Copilot CLI harness (same dir as CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DIR
#                         in most contexts, but guaranteed to exist)
#
# The script is idempotent and safe to call multiple times.

# ── Topology 6: Self-location fallback (AISDLC-557, last resort) ───────────
#
# AISDLC-557: the second adopter report found that when NEITHER
# CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DIR NOR COPILOT_PLUGIN_ROOT is set, self-heal was completely
# unreachable — topologies 1-3 (the only ones that ever attempt self-heal)
# are gated on one of those two vars being set, and topology 4 (cache probe)
# deliberately stays read-only (see the security note below). The result:
# every topology gets tried and the script exits 1 without EVER attempting
# to fix a broken install, even though a fixable one may be sitting right
# next to this very script.
#
# Fix: as a LAST RESORT, derive the plugin dir from this script's own
# on-disk location (SELF_PLUGIN_DIR, computed at the top of this file) and
# run the exact same complete/self-heal/retry sequence topologies 1 and 3
# use.
#
# Security note — this is NOT a reintroduction of the AISDLC-272 / PR #482
# cache-walk vulnerability that removed self-heal from the old topology 4.
# That vulnerability was a WALK across ~/.copilot/plugins/cache/*/ai-sdlc/*/
# that picked an arbitrary "highest semver" directory — a directory that
# might have nothing to do with the one actually in use, so an attacker
# with local write access to the user-writable cache could plant a crafted
# install-runtime-deps.sh there and have it auto-exec on someone else's
# session. This fallback is different in kind, not just degree: it ONLY
# ever targets SELF_PLUGIN_DIR — the exact directory this script itself
# lives in. No directory is walked, compared, or selected. By the time this
# line runs we are already executing arbitrary bash FROM that directory
# (this script), so invoking install-runtime-deps.sh next to it grants no
# privilege an attacker didn't already have by planting a malicious
# resolve-pipeline-cli.sh in the first place.

Tried all install topologies:

  2. $COPILOT_PLUGIN_ROOT/node_modules/@ai-sdlc/pipeline-cli/bin (plugin root)
  3. ~/.copilot/plugins/cache/*/ai-sdlc/*/node_modules/@ai-sdlc/pipeline-cli/bin (cache probe, read-only)

  5. <dir this script lives in>/node_modules/@ai-sdlc/pipeline-cli/bin (self-location, self-heal attempted — AISDLC-557)

Fix options (choose one):
  A. Re-install the plugin via your marketplace:
       /copilot plugin install ai-sdlc
       Then restart GitHub Copilot CLI.

  B. From your plugin install root, run:
       bash "$COPILOT_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/install-runtime-deps.sh" "$COPILOT_PLUGIN_ROOT"
     (Self-heal is operator-initiated only; the resolver no longer auto-execs
      install-runtime-deps.sh from the user-writable plugin cache, since that
      would run any script an attacker could plant under ~/.copilot/plugins/cache/.)

  C. If running from the ai-sdlc monorepo, cd to the repo root before invoking /ai-sdlc execute.

  D. Override by exporting: export PIPELINE_CLI_BIN=/path/to/pipeline-cli/bin
