/**
 * Cryptographic review attestations (AISDLC-74).
 *
 * `/ai-sdlc execute` runs three reviewer subagents (code/test/security) locally
 * before pushing. CI then re-ran the same reviewers via `Post Review Results` —
 * burning tokens on duplicate work.
 *
 * This module provides the primitives `/ai-sdlc execute` and the
 * `verify-attestation.yml` workflow share to skip CI review when a valid local
 * attestation exists. The shape is a DSSE envelope (in-toto / SLSA pattern)
 * carrying a versioned predicate that commits to the commit SHA, diff hash,
 * policy hash, and reviewer agent file hashes — so CI can reject envelopes
 * after force-push, after a policy edit, or after a reviewer agent change.
 *
 * ## Threat model (in-scope)
 *
 *  - Lazy contributor faking attestation         → signature mismatch
 *  - Copy-pasted attestation from another PR     → subject digest mismatch
 *  - Replay after diff changed (force-push)      → diffHash mismatch
 *  - Attestation issued before a policy edit     → policyHash mismatch
 *  - Stale reviewer-agent attestation            → agentFileHash mismatch
 *  - Schema drift / forward-compat smuggling     → schemaVersion enforcement
 *
 * Out of scope: compromised dev machine, compromised CI runner, collusion.
 *
 * ## Why ed25519 + Node's built-in crypto (no Sigstore)
 *
 * The keys are project-controlled, committed in `.ai-sdlc/trusted-reviewers.yaml`,
 * and small (32-byte). Sigstore would add Fulcio + Rekor + transparency log
 * infrastructure for no benefit at this scale. ed25519 is what `ssh-keygen
 * -t ed25519` and `git commit -S` already use; Node's `crypto.sign(null, ...)`
 * supports it natively.

   *
   * Why this is the only content binding in v3:
   *  - `diffHash` (legacy v1, sha256 of literal `git diff` text) broke on

   *    file) was rebase-tolerant for the no-overlap case but broke in the
   *    AISDLC-93 / PR #102 sibling-overlap case (the rebased file's HEAD
   *    blob contained the sibling's contributions, so the head blob SHA
   *    changed even though OUR contribution was unchanged).
   *  - `contentHashV3` commits to the (base, head) blob-pair TRANSITION

   *    paired with the producer-side pre-sign rebase from AISDLC-102 even
   *    in the sibling-overlap case, and a genuine content tampering still
   *    flips the head blob SHA → fileDeltaHash flips → reject (threat
   *    model preserved).
   *
   * Required for v3 envelopes. The dual-hash (v1 → AISDLC-94) and
   * triple-hash (AISDLC-94 → AISDLC-101) windows kept this optional under
   * schemaVersion `v1`; AISDLC-103 narrows the accepted-schema-versions
   * allowlist to `['v3']` and makes `contentHashV3` mandatory in

   * `isAttestationEnvelopePath` for the rationale).
   *
   * Why both v3 AND v4 ship side by side during the transition:
   *  - In-flight envelopes signed before AISDLC-193.1 carry only `v3`.
   *    Verifier accepts those via the existing v3 ancestor walk so the

   *
   * After the transition window, `contentHashV3` will be deprecated

   *   - v4 (`{path, headBlobSha}` from `origin/main..HEAD`) still invalidates

   *   - v5 FREEZES the diff base at `signedMergeBase`. On queue rebase:
   *     verifier uses `git diff <signedMergeBase>..<probe-HEAD>` which
   *     enumerates the SAME file set as the signer. Non-overlapping sibling
   *     merges don't add new files to the set → v5 matches.
   *   - Overlapping sibling merges (a sibling changed the SAME file our PR
   *     touches) → the head blob SHA of that file differs → v5 hash flips →
   *     verifier correctly rejects (operator must re-review).

 *
 * Why per-file delta hashing — and what it adds vs. AISDLC-94's `contentHash`:
 *   - `contentHash` (AISDLC-94) hashes the post-apply blob SHA per file.
 *     If a sibling PR landed between OUR sign + OUR merge AND modified
 *     the SAME file, the rebased file's HEAD blob SHA contains both the
 *     sibling contribution AND ours → contentHash diverges (false reject).
 *   - `contentHashV3` (AISDLC-101) hashes the (base, head) blob-pair
 *     transition per file. Provides a stricter "we moved file F from blob
 *     A to blob B" binding than just "we ended up at blob B". Any genuine
 *     content change still flips the head blob SHA → fileDeltaHash flips
 *     → contentHashV3 flips → reject (threat model preserved).
 *
 * This is the SECOND line of defense in the 3-layer rebase-tolerance
 * plan (AISDLC-94 = Phase 1 verifier-side dual-hash, AISDLC-102 = Phase 1.5
 * producer-side pre-sign rebase, AISDLC-101 = Phase 2 per-file delta).
 * The verifier OR's all three legs during the triple-hash window.
 *
 * Path-delimiter rejection (\t / \n) mirrors `computeContentHash` so the
 * canonical encoding stays injective regardless of caller input.
 *
 * Pure function. Idempotent against double-enumeration via dedup-by-path
 * (last-write-wins per path), same as `computeContentHash`.

 * canonical encoding is `JSON.stringify(sorted-by-path-array-of-{path,
 * headBlobSha}-objects)`, hashed with sha256.
 *
 * Why JSON-of-sorted-array (and not the v3 `<path>\t<fileDeltaHash>\n`
 * canonical) for v4:
 *   - JSON's quoting rules already cover delimiter injection
 *     (a malicious path containing tab/newline can't smuggle through
 *     because they round-trip as escape sequences). We still reject
 *     such paths defensively so the canonical stays injective and
 *     the on-the-wire representation is what readers expect.
 *   - JSON is unambiguous about field ordering (stringify of a
 *     `{path, headBlobSha}` literal always emits `path` first,
 *     `headBlobSha` second — V8's object-key ordering is insertion
 *     order, and we insert in this order in the .map() below).
 *   - Easier to extend: future hash versions can add fields
 *     (`mode`, `executable bit`, etc) to the entry objects without
 *     breaking the canonical encoding scheme.
 *
 * Why this is BASE-INDEPENDENT (= the whole point):
 *   - v3's per-file delta hashes the (base_blob, head_blob) pair.
 *     When the merge queue rebases the PR onto current main (which
 *     advanced past the merge-base the producer signed against), the
 *     base blob SHA for any shared file changes → v3 invalidates.
 *   - v4 hashes only `{path, headBlobSha}`. Whatever the rebase does
 *     to the base ref or the merge-base, as long as the head blob SHA
 *     (= the actual reviewed file content) is unchanged, v4 matches.
 *   - The reviewer never approved "base_blob X → head_blob Y"; they
 *     approved "the file contents at head_blob Y." v4 binds to that
 *     directly.
 *
 * Threat model preserved:
 *   - Genuine post-sign content tampering (someone amends the PR to
 *     add unreviewed code) flips the head blob SHA → v4 hash flips →
 *     verifier rejects. Same threat-model surface as v3.
 *   - The signing key still has to be a trusted reviewer's; v4
 *     doesn't change the signature/key flow, just what the predicate
 *     binds to.
 *
 * Pure function. Idempotent against double-enumeration via dedup-by-path
 * (last-write-wins per path), same as `computeContentHash` and
 * `computeContentHashV3`.
