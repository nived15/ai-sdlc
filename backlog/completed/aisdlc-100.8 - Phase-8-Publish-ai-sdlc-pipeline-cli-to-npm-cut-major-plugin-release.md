## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
RFC-0012 Phase 8 (Section 11). Final phase — publish the new package, cut a major plugin release that ships the architecture, verify both tiers work end-to-end on a fresh install.

## What changes

- `pipeline-cli/package.json` — verify `publishConfig.access: public` is set (lessons from AISDLC-97), `bin: ai-sdlc-pipeline` is correct, version is set per release-please
- `release-please-config.json` and `.release-please-manifest.json` — register `pipeline-cli` package
- Cut a major plugin release (semver minor or major depending on whether the user-facing surface changed — likely minor since `/ai-sdlc execute X` works the same way)
- After release-please opens its PR: verify the publish workflow succeeds for `@ai-sdlc/pipeline-cli`
- After merge: verify on a fresh machine (or fresh `~/.claude/` cache) that `/plugin install ai-sdlc` brings in the CLI binary correctly and `/ai-sdlc execute X` works

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
1. `pipeline-cli/package.json` has correct `publishConfig`, `bin`, version fields
2. release-please config registers the new package; release-please cuts a release PR including it
3. Publish workflow succeeds for `@ai-sdlc/pipeline-cli` (new package on npm)
4. Plugin release cut (major or minor depending on user-facing impact)
5. Fresh install verification: `/plugin install ai-sdlc` on a clean cache pulls in CLI; `/ai-sdlc execute <safe-task>` works
6. End-to-end Tier 2 verification: `pnpm --filter @ai-sdlc/dogfood watch --issue X` works
7. End-to-end portable verification: from outside Claude Code, `npx @ai-sdlc/pipeline-cli execute --task X` works (uses ShellClaudeP if `claude` CLI present)
8. CLAUDE.md `Releases` section (or new section) documents the install path
9. Mark AISDLC-100 (parent) Done after all sub-tasks confirmed

## Final Summary

<!-- SECTION:FINAL_SUMMARY:BEGIN -->
## Summary
RFC-0012 Phase 8 prep landed: flipped @ai-sdlc/pipeline-cli from `private: true` to publishable, added the AISDLC-97 publishConfig block, registered in release-please config + manifest, documented Tier 1/Tier 2 install paths in pipeline-cli/README.md.

## ACs satisfied
- ✓ #1 publishConfig + bin + version verified
- ✓ #2 release-please config + manifest registration
- ✓ #8 install-path docs in pipeline-cli/README.md

## ACs deferred to operator (post-merge)
- ⏸ #3 npm publish (CI workflow on git tag)
- ⏸ #4 Plugin release cut (release-please opens PR after merge)
- ⏸ #5/#6/#7 Fresh-install + e2e verification (clean machine required)
- ⏸ #9 Mark AISDLC-100 (parent) Done after operator-side ACs confirmed

## Verification
- pnpm lint:publishable — 9/9 publishable packages OK (was 8/8; pipeline-cli joined)
- pnpm build && pnpm test (46/46) && pnpm lint && pnpm format:check — clean
- 3 reviews approved: code 0c/0M/2m/1s; test 0c/0M/0m/0s; security 0c/0M/0m/0s
