/**
 * Gate 7 — No invisible dependencies.
 *
 * Stage A (deterministic, hybrid per RFC §4.4): regex for dependency
 * phrases ("requires X", "depends on X", "after X ships", "blocked by
 * X", "once X lands", "needs X") that are immediately followed by a
 * tracked-work identifier (AISDLC-NN, RFC-NNNN, `#NN`, `org/repo#NN`,
 * markdown URL, or a repo-relative file path). The regex pairs the
 * dependency phrase WITH its tracked-work target, so prose like
 * "X requires Y configuration" or "Statistical drift detection depends
 * on a rolling 30d baseline" does not match — those are procedural /
 * algorithmic prerequisites, not invisible tracked-work dependencies.
 *
 * AISDLC-457 (2026-05-27): regex narrowed from "fires on any dep
 * phrase, passes if a ref is in the same sentence" to "fires only on
 * dep-phrase + tracked-work-id pairs, passes if the captured id is in
 * the references[] list". This eliminates the false-positive flood
 * documented in PR #743 / PR #742 where natural-English uses of
 * "requires" / "depends on" / "needs" were being flagged as missing
 * tracked-work refs.
 *
 * Stage B (Phase 2b) catches "unstated structural assumptions" — this
 * gate's regex side only catches the case where the author *names* a
 * tracked-work dependency in the body but doesn't list it in the
 * `dependencies:` frontmatter.
 *
 * AISDLC-563 (2026-08-18): the gate's comparison logic was always correct
 * (extracts the bare tracked-work id, compares case-insensitively against
 * `input.declaredDependencyRefs` / `input.references`) — the bug was that
 * `refineBacklogTask()` (`../ingress.ts`) never populated either
 * field from the task's `dependencies:` / `references:` frontmatter, so
 * every dep-phrase + id pair in the body was flagged as invisible
 * regardless of what frontmatter actually declared. Reproduced twice
 * (AISDLC-557, AISDLC-561): both were "fixed" only by rewording the
 * sentence, never by adding the (already-present) dependency. See
 * `extractDeclaredDependencyRefs()` below for the frontmatter parser that
 * closes the gap.
