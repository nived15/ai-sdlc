# AISDLC-133: Auto-sign DSSE review attestation in the pre-push hook when
# verdict files exist. This removes the "sign-attestation" step from the
# LLM's responsibility per the "anything mechanical → hook/workflow, never
# LLM" pattern (2026-05-01 design discussion).
#
# AISDLC-555: this is the PLUGIN-SHIPPED copy of `scripts/check-attestation-sign.sh`.
# It ships under `ai-sdlc-plugin/scripts/` so it reaches adopter repos (the
# monorepo-root copy at `scripts/check-attestation-sign.sh` never left this
# repo, so an adopter's pre-push hook had nothing to invoke even after
# AISDLC-554 made the signer itself reachable). The one behavioural
# difference from the monorepo copy: Step 5 resolves `sign-attestation.mjs`
# relative to THIS SCRIPT's own on-disk location (see "SELF_SCRIPT_DIR"
# below) instead of `<worktree>/ai-sdlc-plugin/scripts/sign-attestation.mjs`
# — the latter only exists inside the ai-sdlc monorepo. Since this script
# always ships side-by-side with sign-attestation.mjs (same `scripts/`
# directory in every install topology: plugin cache, COPILOT_PLUGIN_ROOT,
# or this monorepo), self-location resolution works regardless of where
# the plugin was installed and regardless of which env vars the invoking
# shell happens to have (git hooks do not inherit COPILOT_PLUGIN_ROOT /
# COPILOT_PLUGIN_DIR from a Copilot CLI session unless the `git push` itself
# ran inside that session's Bash tool).
#
# Why this exists: `/ai-sdlc execute` Step 10 used to drive signing inline
# from the slash command body, which (a) consumed model context for a purely
# deterministic operation and (b) coupled signing to a successful main-session
# turn. Moving signing into pre-push makes it idempotent, automatic, and
# survives session restarts (verdict file lives in the worktree, not /tmp/).
#
# Behaviour:
#
#   1. Honour AI_SDLC_SKIP_ATTESTATION_SIGN=1 (operator deferral / hand-resign).
#   2. Read the per-worktree active-task sentinel at `<worktree>/.active-task`
#      (per AISDLC-81). Sentinel absent → exit 0 (chore PRs, ad-hoc commits,
#      docs-only PRs all push without an attestation).
#   3. Read the verdict file at `<worktree>/.ai-sdlc/verdicts/<task-id>.json`.
#      Verdict file absent → exit 0 (reviewers haven't run yet; the verdict
#      file is the explicit "we're ready to attest" handoff from /ai-sdlc
#      execute). Note: docs-only PRs are handled entirely by CI (AISDLC-214)
#      per RFC-0042 Phase 3. The hook does NOT synthesize verdicts for
#      docs-only changesets — it exits 0 as a no-op, same as any other case
#      where the verdict file is absent.
#   4. Idempotency: if `.ai-sdlc/attestations/<head-sha>.dsse.json` already
#      exists at current HEAD, exit 0 (we already signed this commit).
#   5. Invoke the signer (default:
#      `node <this-script's-directory>/sign-attestation.mjs`; overridable via
#      AI_SDLC_SIGN_ATTESTATION_CMD for tests).
#   6. Stage + commit the new envelope as a chore commit (no --no-verify is
#      needed: husky's pre-commit + commit-msg hooks pass on the chore body
#      because it carries no CI-skip tokens; we DO bypass commit-msg+pre-commit
#      via `git commit --no-verify` to avoid re-entrant lint-staged on a
#      one-file generated commit, which is consistent with the AISDLC-87
#      CI-side attestor's chore-commit pattern).
#   7. Exit 1 with a clear "re-push required" message: the new commit is local
#      only; the operator (or wrapping `git push` retry) must invoke `git push`
#      again to send it. The next push will skip step 5 entirely (idempotent
#      check at step 4 sees the attestation already exists for HEAD).
#
# Activation: an adopter repo's `.husky/pre-push` (or `.git/hooks/pre-push`
# for non-husky repos) resolves the path to THIS file across install
# topologies and invokes it — see the `HUSKY_PREPUSH_SIGN_SNIPPET` template
# in `orchestrator/src/cli/commands/init-templates.ts`, written by
# `ai-sdlc init --with-attestation`. Inside this monorepo, the dogfood
# `.husky/pre-push` continues to call the separate, unmodified
# `scripts/check-attestation-sign.sh` copy directly (repo-relative path) —
# unchanged by AISDLC-555 so the dogfood path keeps working exactly as before.
#
# Override:
#   AI_SDLC_SKIP_ATTESTATION_SIGN=1 git push
# Use only when deferring sign for operator hand-resign — the verifier will
# mark the resulting PR "invalid (missing)" until an attestation lands.
#
# Test override:
#   AI_SDLC_SIGN_ATTESTATION_CMD="<command>" — overrides the signer invocation
#   so tests can stub it without needing the orchestrator built. The override
#   is invoked with the same args the real signer accepts and is responsible
#   for writing `.ai-sdlc/attestations/<head-sha>.dsse.json`.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — nothing to sign (no sentinel, no verdict, or already attested), or
#       AI_SDLC_SKIP_ATTESTATION_SIGN=1 short-circuit.
#   1 — signed + committed an attestation; push aborted; operator must
#       re-run `git push` to send the new chore commit.
#   2 — signer invocation itself failed (refuses to abort the push silently).

# remove the stale envelope BEFORE signing so the PR diff doesn't accumulate
# orphan files.
#
# Predicate: get HEAD~1 SHA (the last code-commit before HEAD, or HEAD
# itself when there's only one commit). Any `.dsse.json` file in
# `.ai-sdlc/attestations/` whose basename (without `.dsse.json`) is NOT
# equal to HEAD~1 SHA (and NOT equal to HEAD_SHA — the new envelope we're
# about to write) is stale from a previous rebase+sign cycle. Remove it.

# re-runs `git push`. Normally the second push hits the envelope-exists
# idempotency check above and short-circuits cleanly.
#
# But there's a window where it doesn't: if the operator amends, rebases,
# or otherwise rewrites HEAD between the two pushes such that the
# attestation file moves but the chore-commit subject line stays in place,
# the envelope-at-HEAD check misses and the hook re-fires — signing a
# second envelope on top, adding another chore commit, and looping forever
# until the operator escapes with AI_SDLC_SKIP_ATTESTATION_SIGN=1.
#
# Reproduction: PR #168 cycled twice on AISDLC-115.6 before the operator
# broke the loop manually.
#
# Defense: if HEAD's commit subject line is itself the auto-sign chore
# we just produced, treat it as a "second push of the same cycle" and
# fall through with exit 0. The next dev commit on top will not match
# this prefix and the hook will fire normally.

# AISDLC-475 Fix B: the signer no longer writes the per-SHA bridge
# (<headSha>.v6.dsse.json) when a patch-id is available. Stage only the
# primary (patch-id) file. ATT_FILE_LEGACY is set to "" when PATCH_ID is
# available, so the legacy stage block below is a no-op in that case.
#
# AISDLC-471: also stage the per-patch-id transcript-leaves directory so the
# per-patch-id leaves file travels with the envelope. Without this, CI checks
# out the branch tree, finds the envelope but not the leaves file, falls back
# to the legacy shared .ai-sdlc/transcript-leaves.jsonl (which has leaves from
# OTHER PRs), computes the wrong Merkle root, and fails with
# "v6: rootSignature did not match any trusted reviewer pubkey".
# The `[ -d ]` guard around the `git add` below (Step 6) is MANDATORY, not
# merely defensive: this script runs under `set -euo pipefail`, and `git add`
# on a non-existent path exits 128 (fatal: pathspec did not match), which would
# abort the push. The guard ensures we only `git add` the directory when it
# actually exists; callers that have not emitted per-patch-id leaves simply
# skip the stage and commit only the envelope.

  # AISDLC-471: stage per-patch-id transcript-leaves alongside the envelope.
  # The `[ -d ]` guard is REQUIRED: under `set -euo pipefail`, running
  # `git add .ai-sdlc/transcript-leaves/` when the directory does not exist
  # exits 128 (`fatal: pathspec '...' did not match any files`) and aborts the
  # push. The guard makes the stage conditional on the directory existing, so
  # callers that have not yet emitted per-patch-id leaves are backward-compat:
  # they skip this stage and still just commit the envelope.
