## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
## Problem

`auto-enable-auto-merge.yml` arms auto-merge via `gh pr merge --auto` using `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`. GitHub's anti-recursion protection prevents workflows from firing on events triggered by `GITHUB_TOKEN`:

> "When you use the repository's GITHUB_TOKEN to perform tasks, events triggered by the GITHUB_TOKEN, with the exception of workflow_dispatch and repository_dispatch, will not create a new workflow run."
> — [GitHub Docs: Triggering a workflow from a workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/triggering-a-workflow#triggering-a-workflow-from-a-workflow)

So when `auto-enable-auto-merge.yml` (running as `github-actions[bot]`) arms auto-merge → queue admits PR → produces a `merge_group` commit → **GitHub does NOT dispatch workflows for that commit because the chain originated from `GITHUB_TOKEN`**. Required checks (`ai-sdlc/attestation`, `ai-sdlc/pr-ready`, `Backlog Drift`, `codecov/patch`) never report → PR sits CLEAN+armed forever in the queue.

## Witnessed empirically 2026-05-07/08 (multiple times today)

Every PR opened today by an automated workflow (`auto-enable-auto-merge.yml` armed it via GITHUB_TOKEN) hit this:
- PR #392 (AISDLC-178.6) — needed manual dequeue+re-arm
- PR #393 (AISDLC-230) — needed manual dequeue+re-arm  
- PR #394 (4 framework-gap tasks) — needed manual dequeue+re-arm
- PR #395 (TUI shortcut + 235/236) — needed manual dequeue+re-arm
- PR #398 (AISDLC-240) — needed manual dequeue+re-arm
- PR #399 (mark 178.7 blocked) — needed manual dequeue+re-arm
- PR #400 (3 framework gaps 241/242/243) — needed manual dequeue+re-arm
- PR #401 (AISDLC-237) — needed manual dequeue+re-arm

**Manual workaround that always works:** dequeue + re-arm with the operator's user PAT:
```
PR_ID=$(gh pr view <N> --json id --jq .id)
gh api graphql -f query="mutation { dequeuePullRequest(input: { id: \"$PR_ID\" }) { mergeQueueEntry { position } } }"
gh pr merge <N> --auto
```
The `gh pr merge --auto` call uses the operator's PAT (when invoked from a developer terminal), which is NOT subject to anti-recursion → workflows fire on the resulting merge_group commit.

This explains:
1. Why `auto-enable-auto-merge.yml` SEEMS to work but PRs sit forever in queue
2. Why manual operator intervention is required for every PR today
3. Why AISDLC-230's "re-arm on check_suite.completed" fix didn't fully solve it (the re-arm STILL uses GITHUB_TOKEN, hits the same anti-recursion wall)

## Proposed fix

### Option A — Use a Personal Access Token (PAT) stored as repo secret

Create a fine-grained PAT with `pull-requests: write` + `contents: read` scope, store as `AUTO_MERGE_PAT` secret. Update `auto-enable-auto-merge.yml`:

```yaml
- name: Refresh auto-merge (via PAT to bypass anti-recursion)
  env:
    GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.AUTO_MERGE_PAT }}  # NOT GITHUB_TOKEN
    GH_REPO: ${{ github.repository }}
    PR: ${{ steps.discover.outputs.pr }}
  run: |
    gh pr merge --disable-auto "$PR" 2>/dev/null || true
    gh pr merge --auto "$PR"
```

Tradeoff: requires operator to mint a PAT + manage rotation. Token has elevated permissions (worth scoping tightly).

### Option B — Use a GitHub App token

Mint a GitHub App with the right permissions, install it on the repo, generate per-run installation tokens via `actions/create-github-app-token`. Tokens issued by GitHub Apps DO trigger workflows.

```yaml
- name: Mint GitHub App token
  id: app-token
  uses: actions/create-github-app-token@v1
  with:
    app-id: ${{ secrets.AUTO_MERGE_APP_ID }}
    private-key: ${{ secrets.AUTO_MERGE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}

- name: Refresh auto-merge
  env:
    GH_TOKEN: ${{ steps.app-token.outputs.token }}
    GH_REPO: ${{ github.repository }}
    PR: ${{ steps.discover.outputs.pr }}
  run: |
    gh pr merge --disable-auto "$PR" 2>/dev/null || true
    gh pr merge --auto "$PR"
```

Tradeoff: more setup (create + install + maintain a GitHub App), but tokens auto-rotate (no manual rotation), per-run scope, audit trail attributed to the App not a user.

### Option C — Document the limitation + retain manual workaround

If neither A nor B is acceptable, update CLAUDE.md operator runbook to make the manual dequeue+re-arm trick the canonical procedure (clearly documented, scriptable as a `/ai-sdlc nudge-queue <pr>` slash command).

Tradeoff: every PR requires manual nudge. Defeats autonomous orchestrator vision.

## Recommendation

**Option A (PAT)** — operator confirmed `AI_SDLC_PAT` secret already exists. This PR ships the swap of `GITHUB_TOKEN` → `AI_SDLC_PAT` in the 3 `GH_TOKEN:` lines of `auto-enable-auto-merge.yml`. Single-line change × 3 occurrences, immediate fix.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] #1 Confirm root cause empirically: open a fresh PR, observe auto-enable-auto-merge.yml arms it, observe queue admission produces merge_group commit with ZERO workflow runs (visible via `gh run list --commit <sha>`)
- [ ] #2 Pick Option A, B, or C (operator decision based on PAT/App tradeoffs)
- [ ] #3 If A or B: implement the token swap in `.github/workflows/auto-enable-auto-merge.yml`; secret created + documented in repo README + operator runbook
- [ ] #4 If C: ship a `/ai-sdlc nudge-queue <pr-number>` slash command that scripts the dequeue+re-arm; document in operator runbook
- [ ] #5 End-to-end verification: open a PR, let auto-enable-auto-merge fire, queue admits, merge_group commit gets workflow runs without manual intervention
- [ ] #6 Update CLAUDE.md to remove the misleading line "auto-enable-auto-merge.yml sets --auto on same-repo PRs ... no manual click needed" and add the actual flow
- [ ] #7 Cross-reference AISDLC-230 (the partial fix that thought it solved the trigger gap) — note that 230 fixed the WORKFLOW trigger event, not the WORKFLOWS-firing-on-merge_group issue this task addresses

## Composes with

- **AISDLC-230** (re-arm on check_suite.completed) — partial fix that addressed PR-side staleness but missed the GITHUB_TOKEN issue
- **AISDLC-237** (contentHashV4 — separate concern, but witnessed alongside this bug)
- **AISDLC-241** (git config race — separate parallel-dispatch concern)
